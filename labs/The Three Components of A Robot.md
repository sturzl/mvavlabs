# Three Components of an Autonomous Robot
Whether driving around Mars or welding cars, all robots have a job. They are robots because the think for themselves, with a computer and code telling them what to do, instead of waiting for a human to control them. A factory robot might do the same exact thing all day, but more complex robots have a third component beyond thinking and doing. For example a car has to react to unexpected changes happening on the road. It uses sensors that send information about the raod to the computer. The computer uses that information to decide what to do next. An autonomous robot! 

1. Form a group of 3 people. Each person gets a role: Sensor, Thinker and Doer. This group is now a robot!
2. The rules are:
    * The Sensor can not move. In fact all they can do is say one of four words to the Thinker: cold, warm, and stop
    * The Thinker can not move. They listen to the sensor and say one of four phrases to the Doer: turn left, turn right, go forward, and stop
    * The Doer listens to the Thinker and SLOWLY follows the instructions
    * The Thinker and Doer must keep their eyes closed
3. Work together as a robot and navigate your group to the target! Good luck and go slow
