# Three Components of a Robot

1. Form a group of 3 people. Each person should pick a role: Sensor, Thinker and Doer. This group is now a robot!
2. The rules are:
    * The Sensor can not move. In fact all they can do is say one of four words: cold, warm, hot, and stop
    * The Thinker can not move and must close their eyes. They can only say one of four phrases: turn left, turn right, go forward, and stop
    * The Doer can move. They can only move following the exact instruction of the Thinker. (NOT the sensor!)
3. The robot must move to their target! Good luck and go slow
