# Three Components of an Autonomous Robot
Whether its welding metal at a factory, or driving around Mars robots all have a job to do. They are robots because the think for themselves, with a computer and code telling the robot what to do next, instead of having a human in control. A factory robot might do the same job all day there are more complex robots that have a third component beyond thinking and doing. For example a car has to react to unexpected changes happening on the road. It needs sensors that send information to the computer, and the computer uses that information to decide what to do next. An autonomous robot! 

1. Form a group of 3 people. Each person gets a role: Sensor, Thinker and Doer. This group is now a robot!
2. The rules are:
    * The Sensor can not move. In fact all they can do is say one of four words to the Thinker: cold, warm, and stop
    * The Thinker can not move. They listen to the sensor and say one of four phrases to the Doer: turn left, turn right, go forward, and stop
    * The Doer listens to the thinker and slowly moves as the thinker tells them
    * The Thinker and Doer must keep their eyes closed
3. Work together as a robot and navigate your group to the target! Good luck and go slow
