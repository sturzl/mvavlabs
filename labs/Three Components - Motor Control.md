# Three Components - Motor control
Now that your robot can move, it is time to start automating it a bit. We are going to take some of hte human error out of the robot. All the roles stay the same, except the Doer will enter commands into a computer to direct the MVAV to the goal.

1. In a paired programming style the group of three should write code that controls the MVAV. You will start with code that can turn each motor. Your goal is to create functions that do the Doers job: Turn left, turn right, go forward, and stop.
2. Move your Human + Car robot to the goal using hte same restrictions as the first lab
