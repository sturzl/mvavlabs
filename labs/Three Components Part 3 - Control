# Three Components Part 3 - Control
Now that your car-robot-person hybrid is rolling you can replace the Thinker and Doer completely with a bit more code.

1. Write a function that listens for the four phrases that the Sensor can say. Then it should call the motor control functions based on that input.
2. See if your car can drive to the target by only taking in information from the Sensor. This will probably take some trial and error :)
3. You've now written a control algorithim!
