# Three Components Part 2 - Motor control
Now that your robot can move, it is time to start automating your car. The first step will be changing the Doer's role. Your goal is to move the car accross the room by giving the Doer the same commands as before. But, the Doer will send commands to the car instead of moving themself.

1. Get the car moving by mob program some new functions. The functions should be the same ones that the Doer follows: turn left, turn right, move forward, and stop. The forward command should have the car roll a couple feet and then stop.
2. Move your Human + Car robot to the goal using the same directions as last time.
3. You've now written motor control code!
