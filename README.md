# MVAV Labs
## Bringing autonomous vehicles to students!


**The Minimum Viable Autonomous Vehicle** project is just starting! Please reach out to me at mrs175@case.edu if you are interested or have suggestions!

This repository holds the labs developed to teach the technologies and concepts used in autonomous vehicles. Some can be done with just a computer and internet access. Others assume students have the [MVAV car](https://github.com/sturzl/mvav). 

[See a lab in action!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRSFsq6A5L4)

See https://mvav.github.io for more information about the project.

Thanks for stopping by! - [Marc Sturzl](https://sturzl.com/)
